Steps to run the project:
1) Download/clone the project.
2) Run 'npm install' command to install dependencies
3) Run 'npm run dev' command to run the project.

Comments:
1) Avoided Typescript due to time constraint
2) Focused on extending functionality over good UI. However UI elements as per the requirements are met.
